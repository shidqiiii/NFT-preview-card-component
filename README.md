**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

Learn to use semantic HTML5 markup and CSS with additional flexbox and transition hover

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.image-overlay {
  width: 300px;
  height: 100%;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  background-color: hsla(178, 100%, 50%, 0.3);
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
  cursor: pointer;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```
